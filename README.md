# Physics Methods 

In the following repository, I will post the different methods that I have created over a certain period of time for python and the resolution of certain physics problems or can even be used in mathematics. The methods are:

- Euler Method 
- Modified Euler Method
- Improved Euler Method
- Runge-Kutta Method
- Shooting method
- Lagrange polynomial interpolation
